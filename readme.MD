#COMP 361 Ray Tracer
The program in this repository was my final assignment for my <em>Introduction to Computer Graphics</em> class. It is a ray tracer that generates spheres and cubes, and is able to generate reflections for spheres. Unfortunately, I had difficulty adding reflection to the cubes and was unable to get it completely functional.

This software was written using C++.
